TO DO:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Just about everything, but short term focus is on:
	- creating good database structure and reader
		- Will take a while
	
	- finishing the super-basic preliminary objects (LineSegment & Vehicle & Tester)
	- fixing angle calc; should take 2 min.

	- creating support for connections between roads; vehicles should be able to pick roads using Drivers
	- interfacing more methods as needed

	
	mid-term larger goals:
		- create GUI for DB import - user should be able to select specific objects and types
		- figure out how I will render visuals - use standard Graphics? Perhaps OpenGL?
			- 2D is the focus. Really don't need anything overkill.
		- listener system for controls (stoplights, signs, etc.)
	
	long-term larger goals:
		- editor for roads and vehicles
		- full-on real-time simulation
